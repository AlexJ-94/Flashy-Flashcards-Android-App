course-project created for AlexJ-94
I would like to make an application where you can make your own flashcards.
I would like to be able to change many different settings such as the color of the cards.
I would also like to add a feature where you can set a specific amount of time you have to answer the question 
and if you donâ€™t answer it will move on to the next question.
